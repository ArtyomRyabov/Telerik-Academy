Java and C#
-----------
Java and C# are two very similar programming languages that are well-optimized and have stricter rules to help prevent 
programming mistakes. Code in these languages need to be “compiled” into lower-level code before it runs, and all variables 
need to be “declared” with their name and type. They also enforce/encourage a methodology known as “object-oriented 
programming”, requiring all code to belong to an “object”.

People who program in these languages use an IDE to write their software in, which can provide various features to help 
with programming, such as auto-completion suggestions while they code, and automatic highlighting of certain errors. The 
rules in these languages will help you detect certain errors before you even run your code, which can be especially helpful 
when learning programming. However, Java or C# are not made for writing simple scripts, and they are not as popular for 
quickly creating dynamic websites.

Java vs. C#
Both languages are popular in large companies, large projects and in projects that need optimized code.

Java code does not get directly converted into machine code. Instead it runs on a "virtual machine" which can run on all 
sorts of different hardware. This lets Java fulfill their slogan of "Write once, run anywhere". Java was once intended for 
widespread use on web browsers, but that is less common and a very different language is used for that (Javascript). It is 
used in regular desktop applications, but its most popular consumer use is for creating Android apps. In large companies it 
is used both internally and to power their websites. It is also commonly taught in colleges.

C# can be called "Microsoft's Java", but they have also added features that Java does not have. It does not support multiple 
platforms as well as Java does, but it does fit well with Microsoft's other offerings. If someone is within a Microsoft world 
anyways, it might make sense to use C# over Java.

In summary, you should learn one of these languages if you:

    Want to program for a big company
    Want extra rules to help prevent errors
    Require very fast software for large projects

You should likely do C# if you'll just be doing things on Windows, but you should do Java if you want to make Android apps or 
are going to a college that does Java.

Javascript
----------
Since Javascript runs in all browsers, it can be a good choice of language to learn. No installation is required, since it can 
immediately be tried out in the browser. Javascript can be used for visual effects, but also for doing things without having 
to update the entire webpage. Modern web apps require Javascript for many of their features. (For example, try loading Gmail 
without javascript.) Javascript is also used in many web-related areas, such as creating browser extensions. It is often used 
for other areas that beginners might be interested in, such as creating AppScripts to work with Google Apps, or On(X) to 
automate things on Android. If you are interested in doing any of these things, Javascript may be a good language to learn. 
However, Javascript has certain confusing parts, so if you’re not planning on using it for the above purposes, you can try a 
more elegant language such as Python.

PHP
---
PHP is a language built for creating dynamic web pages, and it runs on the server-side. Let’s say you just finished building 
a website without programming and now you want to be able to customize things further. You want to learn how to program the 
brains of the website, i.e. the back-end. A large number of websites and scripts are built using PHP, and web hosts often come 
with a list of one-click-install scripts. If you want to create a plugin for WordPress or work with the same script that runs 
Wikipedia, then PHP is for you. Practically all dynamic web hosts run PHP, and its very easy to get started with it. However, 
PHP has some issues, such as a messy syntax and certain inconsistencies and quirks. This means you should probably learn a 
different language if you just want to learn programming or you want to create an entirely new web app. However, PHP has 
improved over time, and if it fits your purposes, go ahead and learn it.
==============================================================================================================================

Python
------
If you just want an easy and elegant language to learn programming, Python is a good choice. Unlike PHP and Javascript, which 
are made for the web, Python is a general-purpose language that can be used outside of websites. Python aims to be very 
readable, so even a beginner could figure out what some simple Python code accomplishes. Python has the unusual feature of 
using indentation to mark different parts of code. This makes the code look less cluttered, but can sometimes cause issues 
when copying code. Python is a good choice to go with if you don’t have a specific goal that fits with one of the other 
languages.

Ruby
----
Ruby is similar to Python in many ways. It is a general-purpose language which is focused more on programmer productivity than 
running-time on a machine. This ‘slowness’ isn’t really an issue for most things a beginner will be building. Ruby has become 
popular in the last few years due to the website-building framework written in it – Ruby on Rails. Rails developed certain 
principles (such as “convention over configuration”) that let programmers built websites quickly. If you are interested in 
creating websites with Rails, then it obviously makes sense to learn some Ruby. While Rails can be used without that much Ruby 
knowledge, I think a beginner should first learn a simple language before taking on a complex framework.
